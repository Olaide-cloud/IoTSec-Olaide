# Secure IoT-Enabled Wearable Devices

## Overview

This software system secures IoT-enabled wearable devices like smart watches, fitness trackers, etc that collect sensitive user data. It implements multifactor authentication and encryption to prevent unauthorized access. 

The system involves:

- Wearable IoT sensors
- Mobile app 
- Web server
- Authentication module
- Database

## Wearable IoT Sensors

The sensors in wearable devices capture user activity data like step count, heart rate, location, etc. Each sensor has a unique ID for identification.

Security features:

- AES encryption applied before data transmission to prevent hacking.
- Secure key exchange with gateway to decrypt sensor data. 
- Hardware enhancements like secure enclaves will enable on-sensor encryption.
- Firmware updates to patch vulnerabilities. Digitally signed.

## Mobile App

The mobile app allows users to access their wearable device data. 

Security features:  

- One-time password (OTP) required in addition to username and password for user login.
- Continous background re-verification of fingerprints for passive auth.
- One-time passwords used to authenticate pairing between user and sensor.
- HTTPS/TLS for secure communications with server.  
- Local encryption of data like biometrics.

## Web Server 

Hosts the application interface and logic for users.

Security features:

- Role based access control using multifactor authentication.  
- Isolated in secure network with firewalls. Hardened against attacks.
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention. DDoS protection.  
- Communications over HTTPS using latest TLS protocol.

## Authentication Module

Handles user verification and device pairing via one-time passwords.

Security features:  

- Validates OTP, username and password provided by user during login.
- Issues short-lived OTPs for associating a user and wearable sensor.  
- Manages keys for sensor data encryption/decryption.

## Database 

Stores user activity data collected from sensors. 

Security features:

- Encryption of data at rest via AES-256. Access controls limit visibility.
- Private isolated network secures database. Hardened OS. 
- Compliant with regulations like HIPAA for healthcare data.
- Backups and replication prevent data loss.
- Monitoring to detect potential breaches. 

## Conclusion

This system secures sensitive user data from wearable devices using multifactor authentication, encryption, access controls, patching, etc. The layered approach protects data confidentiality and integrity.
